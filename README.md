Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the process of creating high-quality software application that solve real-world problems.
It is important because it solves modern problems by creating software that enhances different fields like communication, commerce and entertainment.


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
a. Development of programming languages for example Fortran and C.
b. Establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s.
c. The advent of structured programming in the 1970s.


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
a.Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
b.Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
c.Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
d.Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
e.Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
f.Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is an approach with sequential distinct phases like requirements, design and implementation flowing downwards like a waterfall while agile is an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Waterfall method would be appropriate for creating systems that require detailed documentation and strict adherence to requirements such as government related projects.
Agile method would be appropriate for development of video games which get better through making changes from user suggestions.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
a.Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
b.Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
c.Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
a.Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code. Examples include Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA.
b.Version Control Systems (VCS) help track changes to source code and coordination of work among team members. Examples include Git, Subversion.


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
a.Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays. This can be solved through regular communication with the client to ensure that the developers don't have to start over after finding out about a requirement when they are done.
b.Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality. This can be solved through prioritizing development so that developers avoid last minute development that is susceptible to issues.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
a.Unit testing focuses on testing individual components (functions, methods, or modules) in isolation to verify they work correctly. It is important because it identifies bugs at an early stage, reducing debugging time later and ensures that each component functions as expected before integration.
b.Integration testing verifies that different modules or services work together as expected when combined. It is important beacuse it detects issues in communication between modules, such as incorrect data flow or API mismatches and ensures that individual components work well as a system.
c.System testing evaluates the entire application as a whole to verify it meets the specified requirements.It is important because it validates end-to-end workflows and system functionality. It also identifies defects related to UI, performance, security, and scalability.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the process of crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
It is important because it helps us get clear and specific answers because we learn how to ask AI specifically what we want.


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Initial prompt: Tell me about mammals.
Improved prompt: Tell me about sea mammals.
